# otp-network-comparer
This project will extend the [OpenTripPlanner](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner) client to handle separate gtfs files for a single area and allow users to switch between them.
## Background
VTA is going through a network update and the planners want to be able to show people how the new network affects them.  It seems like the best way people understand how network changes affects them is through trip planners and isochromes.  Thus it was conceived to create a dual trip planner and isochrome switcher to allow the public to see how this next network will really affect them.

## Inspiration
